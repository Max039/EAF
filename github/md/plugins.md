### Plugin Usage Instructions

To enable automatic usage of plugins upon launch, follow these steps:

1. Move the folder containing the plugin source files into the installation directory under:

    ```bash
    EAF_HOME/plugins/plugin_name/
	```
2. When the EvoAl version is updated, or changes are detected in the files (added, removed, or modified) within the plugin folder, the plugin will be recompiled before the next launch.
